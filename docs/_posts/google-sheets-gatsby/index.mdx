## GatsbyJS ❤️ Google Sheets

One of the reasons I love working with Gatsby specifically, and React in general, is how easy it usually is to find a plugin to solve whatever problem you're trying to solve. I'm a big fan of not reinventing the wheel. Chances are, you're not the first developer in the world who has come up against a certain use case, so it's usually just a matter of building off of someone else's solution. It turns out that it's very easy to set up an ad hoc backend for Gatsby with Google Sheets by using the [gatsby-source-google-spreadsheets](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-google-spreadsheets/) plugin by [Cian Butler](https://github.com/butlerx).

### The Query

Following the [instructions on the plugin's page](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-google-spreadsheets/), it's simple enough to configure. The only gotcha which I will go into detail below is using a Google Sheets API key in your Gatsby site. Once configured, you should see your specified spreadsheet show up in the GraphQL query explorer, which can be found at `http://localhost:8000/___graphql` if you've run `gatsby develop` from the command line. 

Once you can confirm that the data is coming into your Gatsby site this way, you can run a query inside one of your components to render the data. Spreedsheet tabs will show up at the root level of your site's query explorer with a `allGoogle[Tab]Sheet` naming convention, and spreadsheet columns will be converted to nodes. As an example, this is how the query from my [reading list](/reads) tab of my spreadsheet data looks, grabbing just the nodes I need:

```jsx
// GraphQL query for reads.js

const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`
  query {
    allGoogleReadsSheet {
      nodes {
        author
        addAuthors
        dateRead
        title
      }
    }
  }
`)
```

### Mapping the Results

With the query established, using the React hook, `useState`, to set the starting year for my [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) tabs, it's just a matter of iterating through the data with `map()`. In the example below, I've separated the data into tabs by year, so I first iterate through the `years` array before iterating through the query data, only returning entries that match the selected year. This is a sample of my completed [reading list](/reads) JSX:

```jsx
// reads.js

// import statements, yada yada yada
// ...

const ReadsPage = props => {
  const [yearSelected, setYearSelected] = useState(2021)
  const years = [2021,2020,2019]

  const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    query {
      allGoogleReadsSheet {
        nodes {
          author
          addAuthors
          dateRead
          title
        }
      }
    }
  `)
  return (
  // ...
    <h2 className="mt-4">Books Read</h2>
    <p className="mb-4 h5">Sorted by Year Finished, then Author</p>
    <Tabs
      id="books-read"
      activeKey={yearSelected}
      onSelect={(k) => setYearSelected(k)}
    >
      {years.map((year, index) => { // iterating through `years` array
        return (
          <Tab key={year} eventKey={year} title={year}>
            <Table responsive="sm">
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th style={{ width: '50%' }}>Title</th>
                  <th>Authors</th>
                  <th className="text-right" width="135">
                    Date Finished
                  </th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                {data.allGoogleReadsSheet.nodes.map(({ 
                  // this is where the GraphQL magic happens
                  author,
                  addAuthors,
                  dateRead,
                  title
                }, index) => {
                  return dateRead 
                  && dateRead.includes(year)
                  && (
                    <tr key={index}>
                      <td>{title}</td>
                      <td>
                        {author}
                        {addAuthors && (<>,<br/>{addAuthors}</>)}
                      </td>
                      <td className="text-right">{dateRead}</td>
                    </tr>
                  )
                })}
              </tbody>
            </Table>
          </Tab>
        )
      })}
    </Tabs>
// ...
)}

export default ReadsPage
```

### Environment Variables

As mentioned above, the one gotcha I ran into using the latest version of Google Sheets API and [gatsby-source-google-spreadsheets](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-google-spreadsheets/) is the need to use an API key. While it's a trivial task to set up a free API key in Google's developer console, I made the rookie move of including said API key in my source code. 😬 This was immediately flagged by Github as a security risk and I quickly got a crash course in Gatsby/Gatsby Cloud environment variables. Fortunately, they really do make it easy ([see documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/local-development/environment-variables/)). 

For my local build, I simply had to create a `src/.env.development` file with the `SHEET` and `API_KEY` variables specified, and made sure to hide it from Git in my `.gitignore` file. For the [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/cloud/) interface, it only takes a few clicks to define the same variables for production builds. Take a look at my modified `gatsby-config.js` file with properly hidden env variables: 
```js
// gatsby-config.js

// somewhere halfway down the page...
{
  resolve: 'gatsby-source-google-spreadsheets',
  options: {
    spreadsheetId: process.env.SHEET,
    apiKey: process.env.API_KEY
  }
},
// ...
```

### Going Forward

Knowing what I now know about GraphQL makes me want to do a full rewrite of [String Band Database](http://stringbanddatabase.com/), a project I initially wrote in jQuery back in [2013](https://mummers.github.io/stringbands/sbdb-1.0/index.html) using a plugin called [Sheetrock](https://chriszarate.github.io/sheetrock/) that allows you to do SQL-like queries against a public Google spreadsheet. The project has since been moved over to Github Pages and is spearheaded by my fellow banjo player and web developer, [TJ Ferry](https://tjferry.com), who has done a bang-up job adding new features and curating the content. 

The time to modernize our searchable listing of old string band themes is nigh!
