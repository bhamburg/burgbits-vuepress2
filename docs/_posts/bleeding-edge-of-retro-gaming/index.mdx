## New Toy: MiSTer FPGA

The MiSTer project is one of the coolest gizmos to come along in a while. Tonight I finally completed my build thanks to parts from [misteraddons.com](https://misteraddons.com) and I couldn’t be happier with the final product. Ask me anything about the ideal way to experience hardware-accurate classic console and arcade gaming, and some classic computers too! I’m a Patreon supporter of the devs and an advocate for this project and retrogaming in general. We should preserve these gems of nostalgia for generations to come, in as close to the original experience as possible with modern conveniences.

[SmokeMonster](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCskJUZ8X__mwcoU9HvGKCMg) is one of my favorite guys in the retro gaming scene and I think he does a great job explaining what the MiSTer is and why it's important. Not only are his videos very informative but he's made substantial contributions to the cause of preserving gaming history.
