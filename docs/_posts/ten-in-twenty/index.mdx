## Ten Things I Learned in 2020

1. “Reasoning will never make a man correct an ill opinion, which by reasoning he never acquired.”
—Jonathan Swift

2. It depends on the nature of the work and the home, but working from home can be more productive than working in an open office layout. Not only could that meeting have been an email, that department could have been a project.

3. The wheel is still an underrated invention.

4. It’s not enough to say, “practice with a metronome.” The correct advice is, “don’t practice without a metronome.”

5. Upper chord extensions (9ths, 11ths, 13ths) are perfectly reasonable on four strings (or fewer!) and can really add color to your playing in the right context.

6. The video games industry is now larger than the movie and music industries _combined_. The best examples of the medium interweave interactive experiences with cinematography, music, and art in ways that traditional media never could.

7. The retro gaming scene is in very good hands. Thanks to some passionate fans, there are constantly new and improved ways to experience and appreciate classics using modern technologies, whether in the interest of authenticity or novelty.

8. Mindset matters more than methodology. Regardless of the problem, framing it properly in your mind first is the only effective way to find a resolution. You might even find that your problem isn’t a problem at all.

9. If everywhere you go smells like shit, maybe it’s time to check your shoes.

10. “Time obliterates the fictions of opinion and confirms the decisions of nature.” 
—Cicero
