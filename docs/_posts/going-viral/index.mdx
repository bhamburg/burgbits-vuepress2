## That Escalated Quickly

My wife Andrea likes to go all out on holidays for our girls, especially Halloween. In past years they've been grandmas, Lucy and Ethel, and chickens. This year she had us up our game and construct a prop to go along with their costume. The idea was that the girls were going to be Beanie Babies inside a claw machine. The task was for me to find a way to build a box around the Little Tikes wagon we have so that I could pull them around the neighborhood. Once my dad got word of this plan, he immediately offered his tools and his services. It turned out to be a great bonding experience with my dad, and something that my wife and I could take pride in as our girls really got a kick out of the idea. Needless to say, it was a huge hit at several "Trunk-or-Treat" events we attended.

What we didn't expect is for the response on social media to be so... *large*. The original video Andrea originally posted on Facebook got picked up by an ABC affiliate in North Carolina and it was off to the races. Eventually we got got approached by [Storyful](https://video.storyful.com/record/634) to whom we sold the rights of the original video. The original post gathered over 1.5 million views so far and Storyful is still distributing it to news outlets around the world. ðŸŒŽðŸ‘€

The final act to these extraordinary few days began when a rep from Good Morning America reached out to Andrea on Facebook with a request to interview her over Facetime and for us to submit some photos of the build process for the claw machine prop. Check out the video below. Happy Halloween!
