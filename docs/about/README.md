*The Hamburgs in Walt Disney World*

I’m a software engineer, designer, and musician. Most of my days are spent working and playing in Philadelphia where I live with my wife, Andrea, and twin daughters, Elizabeth and Louise. We have a young Australian Cattle Dog mix named Ludwig, and an old rabbit named Java. But this is just the tip of the Brian Hamburg iceberg. Within these pages you can learn more about what's going on in my life professionally and recreationally.

Ultimately I'm just trying to balance being a father, husband, son, web professional, musician, nerd, colleague, friend, and decent human being in the crazy world we currently live in.

## Music

#### Oh, the places you’ll go... with a banjo!

When I'm not behind my laptop, you can often find me behind my four-string, plectrum banjo, plunking out traditional jazz favorites written circa a century ago. The style I play is less *Country Bear Jamboree* and more *Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue*, if that makes any sense.

Some of the great artists who have inspired my playing and interest in the instrument include but are certainly not limited to [Eddie Peabody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kf3Cx_odqY), [Ken Aoki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j714N05_SeQ), and [Buddy Wachter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAViBbCtmoI).

I've also been fortunate to have the chance to play with some great traditional jazz musicians in the Philadelphia area while gigging with [Drew Nugent and the Midnight Society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNOZTVwBa_4) and the [Red Hot Ramblers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8COWgA1Hcxc).

## Other Hobbies

Besides keeping this site up-to-date using the latest tech, I also helped build the [String Band Database](http://stringbanddatabase.com), which is a searchable listing of string band themes from the Mummers Parade with videos and parade data. It was a good exercise in using a Google Sheet as a RESTful backend.

I'm always trying to read more. Mostly sci-fi, pop-sci, philosophy, and self-help books, but I'm open to anything. It's hard to find the time, but I've been doing a pretty good job of keeping up with my reading list. Ryan Holiday and Robert Greene are two of my more recent favorite authors.

Taking a proactive approach with my health and running when I can has become a priority, with a target goal of running a half marathon (13.1 miles) before my 40th birthday.

I like to think playing Super Mario Bros. and arcade games in the late 80s, and tinkering with DOS and Windows 95 to get multiplayer Doom going, is what initially drove my interest in technology, and specifically interactive digital experiences. My tastes gravitate towards games from and inspired by that 8- and 16-bit age of pixel art. Also, the heavily-syncopated, early-jazz-inspired soundtracks of the games from the NES/SNES era definitely affected my musical taste in a positive way. I love cathode-ray tube scan lines in 240p RGB, and keeping up with the latest advances in FPGA-based systems with near-perfect accuracy and zero-to-low input latency, particularly the [MiSTer FPGA](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki) hardware emulation project and the [RetroTINK](https://www.retrotink.com/product-page/5x-pro) line of analog-to-digital video upscalers. I've also more recently become a huge fan of the [*Soulsborne*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souls_(series)) games by FromSoftware, mostly playing them on PlayStation 5.
